| INSTALLATION AND USE |
+----------------------+


*******
* (0) *
*******
Run:
opam install -v ocamlmath

*******
* (1) *
*******
Read $doc/ocamlmath/MathSpec/index.html 
to have an idea of the calculations proposed.

*******
* (2) *
*******
Read $doc/ocamlmath/GraphicmathSpec/index.html 
to have an idea of supplementary graphic and browsing (see step (6)) functions.

* (3) *
*******
In order to use source code or libraries proposed in the distribution, 
no further installation is required. 

Use the toplevels "mathtop" or "graphicmathtop", by typing

$bin/mathtop

or

$bin/graphicmathtop


or load the libraries "${lib}/ocamlmath/math.cma" or "${lib}/ocamlmath/graphicmath/graphicmath.cma" into Ocaml, 
or use the instructions '#load "nums.cma" ;; #load "str.cma" ;; 
#use "{lib}/ocamlmath/math.ml" ;;' et caetera.
It may be convenient to add the instructions "open Math ;;" or "open Graphicmath ;;" :
refer to the files "${lib}/ocamlmath/.ocamlinit" and "${lib}/ocamlmath/graphicmath/.ocamlinit".


>>---------------------------
The toplevel executables in $bin are in fact shell script which call "ledit" when it exists in the user's $PATH
and apply it to the toplevels "${lib}/ocamlmath/topmath" and "${lib}/ocamlmath/graphicmath/topgraphicmath", 
initialized by the corresponding ".ocamlinit" files.

On a non BSD system, the toplevels actually used are "{lib}/ocamlmath/nonBSDtopmath" and "{lib}/ocamlmath/graphicmath/nonBSDtopgraphicmath".
In case of problem, the following instructions should work.

ledit ocamlrun ${lib}/ocamlmath/topmath
or
ocamlrun ${lib}/ocamlmath/topmath

and

ledit ocamlrun ${lib}/ocamlmath/graphicmath/topgraphicmath
or
ocamlrun ${lib}/ocamlmath/graphicmath/topgraphicmath

(The bytecode executables differ only by the shebangs.)
---------------------------<<


Go to step (6).

**********
* (3bis) *
**********
To know if the operating system respects the BSD standard,
the answer of the command :

which ocamlrun

must be :

/usr/local/bin/ocamlrun

In case of a different answer, like :

/usr/bin/ocamlrun

the operating sytem does not respect the BSD standard.

It is possible to recompile or edit the bytecode executables in order to write a shebang compatible with the operating system.
In any case, taking the bytecode file as argument of the instruction "ocamlrun" should solve the problem of the path.

Go to steps (1) and (2) and follow the different links 
in order to deepen your reading.

(In the following the prefix "Spec." is facultative 
if the instruction "open Spec ;;" is written in the file ".oamlinit".)

Inside "topgraphicmath", in order to find a function "foobar", 
use the instruction

Spec.which "foobar" ;;

This applies both to functions from the standard distribution 
and from the present math distribution.
(It may be taylored to anything else 
by modifying the data arrays of the Spec module.)

If the answer array is not empty, take one of its item "Thing.foobar" 
and read the basic specification:

Spec.what "Thing.foobar" ;;

for this math distribution.
For another distribution, provide as first argument 
a path to the html documentation of the source code.

With the same environment (mutatis mutandis), get the source code 
(also to be known as extended specification) of the function :

Spec.how "Thing.foobar" ;;

And in order to know where this function is called, type

Spec.why "Thing.foobar" ;
Spec.why "foobar" ;;

In these last instructions, the string of the function may be cut ad libitum 
in order to generalize the search.

* (5) *
*******
In order to develop further bytecode or nativecode, read and use 
"depend.sh" and "bytecode_instructions.sh" and "native_instructions.sh" 
and "depend.defaults" and "depend.conf" and "depend.txt".

Create shell scripts and taylor files to your use.
